# systeme_de_recommandation_des_films
collaboration for improving a movie recommendation system using artificial intelligence under python

we have improved a system for recommending films. The goal of the system is to provide accurate movie recommendations to users. Typically, basic recommendation systems consider one of the following factors to generate recommendations:
- user preference (i.e. based on content filtering)
- the preference of similar users (collaborative filtering, for example). To build a stable and precise environment
The recommendation system used in this project is based on element-based collaborative filtering (in this case movies).
